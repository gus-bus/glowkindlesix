          <p>With news about the recent giant rat infestation plaguing the local craft beer tavern, the Wizard's Tower Brewery, a group of misfit adventurers answer the call for help in hopes for some easy coin.
						Xexenia and Makaria were the first to arrive at the brewery. There was a sign on the door saying "CLOSED, UNDER REPAIR". With a rap on the door, and a moment later, a small peep hole opened down low. "Sorry we are closed until further notice, please come back later" said a voice from within. Xexenia replied, "We are about the rat problem". With an apology, the door swung open and there stood in the doorway was a gnome with a large pot beer belly, sporting a long white beard resting atop it. "Ahhh yes I see the guild was successful in spreading the word, please come in and don't mind the mess. My name is Glowkindle".
						As they walked in, the entire building was infused with the small of hops and beer but as they looked around they saw what seemed to have been a small skirmish that happened within the brewery. Broken pieces of glass were swept in a small pile while some tables were shoved at the far side of the bar, barricading a door shut. "As you can see, we had quite a fight with those foul creatures!" exclaimed Glowkindle. "Here let me serve you a round of beer and we can get to discuss the matter at hand". After getting their orders and sitting down a tremendous obnoxiously loud knock on the door reverberated the building. "I wonder who that is, maybe some more adventurers like yourselves?" Glowkindle said as he went to answer the door. When he opened the door he was greeted by a couple of more adventurers, Ovrin and Regar. He also invited them in to have a seat with the others and got their beers too. Just as Glowkindle was about to sit yet another knock on the door. "Wow this is beginning to get a bit crowded now eh?" Glowkindle joked as he went again to the door and saw a tabaxi named Swift. When asked what beer she would like Swift replied "All of them!" To which Glowkindle happily provided as a beer flight. Another knock on the door, "Seems that the guild have outdone themselves this time!" Glowkindle remarked as he went to open the door yet again. A half-elf by the name of Astrid Aes wielding a staff with a cobra head bust was also looking to rid the brewery of the infestation entered.</p>

						"Well looks like there's a full party here now! Thank you all for coming" said Glowkindle, "you all know of the trouble I am having with the rats. They appeared after me and my crew were working on expanding the brewery cellars. We dug into the far wall and to our surprise found a way into the old ruins of the wizard's tower. Then all of a sudden a horde of rats came bursting through! Rats the size of dogs! We all managed to rush out and barricade the door shut behind us. All you have to do is dispose of the rats so we can get to expanding and open the brewery again. Any questions?" [someone asks how much the reward was and how many rats he saw] . "Well the reward was posted for 100 gp and I think I saw about a dozen of those foul creatures". With the reward set and the party given the information, Glowkindle excused himself and went back to cleaning up the place.

						After introducing each other the party went to tackle the problem. With Regar leading the way, he grabbed a table and hurled it behind him across the room and entered the cellar. Meanwhile Astrid and Swift were still sitting at the table drinking their beers, content with letting the rest of the group go scout ahead. Entering the cellar, it was very dark and damp. The wooden stairs creaked as they descended into the cool, dry air of the cellar, which was infused with the smell of beer and damp fur. Somewhere in the darkness they heard the scrabbling sound of claws on floorboards and faint squeaking noises.

						As they bravely entered deeper into the cellar, Xexenia incanted a spell which produced light for better vision. Not a moment later they found themselves becoming surrounded by a swarm of giant rats. Regar roared in anger as he scrambled on top of some beer barrels to get at the rats perched atop it. With a mighty swing he missed, the momentum driving him to whirl around and lose his footing falling flat on his back. The rats started to bite and scratch at the fallen barbarian. The rest of the party engaged the rest of the mob. Meanwhile, Astrid and Swift were still drinking their beers when they heard the bloodcurdling roar of rage followed by a subsequent this. With a sigh they both decided that they might need their help and hurried over to the cellar, still clutching their beverages. As they entered they saw that everyone was engaged with fending off gigantic rats. Swift gently placed down her beer flight, being careful as to not spill a drop and unfurled a cloth. Inside were 20 darts to which she hurled into the air in the hopes of hitting a rat that was attacking Ovrin. One dart managed to stick into a rat while the rest of the darts clattered harmlessly onto the floor. Meanwhile Astrid conjured a small bolt of fire within her hand and unleashed it toward a rat biting at Xexenia. It hit the rat which burst into flame and let out a screech as it writhed in pain before falling lifelessly dead. Astrid drew first blood. Ovrin meanwhile swung his warhammer proclaiming to hit the rats pussy to the surprise of the rest of the party. His strike was true and another vermin was down. Makaria, rushed in with both shortswords slashing and dismembering a rat. Xexenia, surrounded by all sides was holding her own. The light she produced to give light was now turned into a deadly flame which she used to singe the rats around her. Regar, recovering from his fall, roared with even more ferocity as he got up and swung his mighty greatsword at the pests. This time his strike struck true and the rats were split in twine.

						As the skirmish continued, the rats were dealing considerable damage to the party. Things were looking dire but the rats were slowly but surely falling one by one. Just as the last of the rats were dealt with, Regar saw 3 scurrying across the corridor in the hole at the far end of the cellar. Before moving on, the party decided to take some time to rest and heal their wounds, the vermin was yet to be snuffed out. Xexenia was the most injured but she had come prepared with herbs gathered from the forest. She used her knowledge of healing to dress her wounds sustained from the rats.

					After recovering from the small skirmish, the party ventured forth into the dark corridor. Through the hole in the wall, they saw a dusty stone corridor, its floor lying around a foot below that of the cellar. Over to the left they saw the start of a staircase buried in collapsed masonry, earth and rubble was blocking the way completely. To the right the passage heads around a corner with the celing being covered by a mass of spider webbing. On the wall they can just make out what appears to be writing in clear gold script:
