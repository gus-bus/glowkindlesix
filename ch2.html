               Screaming. It woke her in the middle of the night. At first it was scattered and sparse but quickly grew in volume and rhythm, a grotesque symphony of pain being brought to an unholy crescendo. Her bedroom door burst open, her father stood in the doorway and even in the faint twilight she could make out the fear in his eyes. She had never known her father to be afraid. They were running now. Her mother was dead, she thinks. There was a body of a woman face down in a pool of blood as they raced from her home. It was all a blur, no time to check, no time to think, but it had to have been her mother, who else could it have been? Her mother is dead, she knows. All around fires blazed, the entire town was burning.

                It has been weeks since the Wolves of Welton had been vanquished and the Party have been busy enjoying their spoils with many rounds purchased at the local tavern (at a heavily discounted price, naturally), fine meals accompanied by even finers wines and six wolf pups being trained to mixed success. They may well have spent out their days in the quiet town of Welton but the call of adventure is strong for the Glowkindle Six and, after the town's supply of tequila was drained dry, they were back on the road in search of glory.
