                Screaming. It woke her in the middle of the night. At first it was scattered, sparse but grew in volume and rhythm, piercing wails echoing in the night. The bedroom door burst open, her father stood in the doorway. Even in the faint twilight she could make out the fear in his eyes. She had never known her father to be afraid. They were running now. Her mother was dead, she thinks. There was a body face down in a pool of blood, a woman? It was all a blur, no time to check, no time to think, who else could it have been? Her mother is dead, she knows. All around fires blazed, the town was burning. Her vision was blurred from the smoke but the smell was inescapable, rotting flesh and burnt hair filled her nostrils with the screams deafening now as they raced through the living hell that was once their home. And then they were on them. Foul abominations, demons from the deep, an unholy conjoining of man and eel, clicking and gurgling to each other, was that excitement in their eyes? Too late, they rushed forward as one, five of them attacking from all sides, she was pushed down to the ground but saw her father sliced across the chest, his blood gushing out in an arterial spray, slumping down, murmuring under his breath. His incantation burst forth as a fiery explosion, blasting three of the monsters off their feet, the other two warily backed away. A horn sounded. From the darkness spilled forth twenty, thirty, fifty of the foul creatures, gurgling and whooping as they marched in. This was the end. There was no escape. No hope. Her father turned to look at her. There was no fear in his eyes this time, instead there was sadness. A sadness girded by cold determination. His hands began weaving signs in the air, his hair rising in the hot summer night, his mouth opened for the spell..

                It has been weeks since the wolves of Welton had been vanquished and the party have been busy enjoying their spoils with many rounds purchased at the local tavern (at a heavily discounted price, naturally), fine meals accompanied by even finers wines and six wolf pups being trained to mixed success. They may well have spent out their days in the quiet town of Welton but the call of adventure is strong for the Glowkindle Six and, after the town's supply of tequila was drained dry, they were back on the road in search of glory. Makaria hummed a tune as they walked through the undulating green hills of the surrounding countryside, a cool breeze blowing through the fine summer day.
            </p>
            <p>
              A clattering of hooves rounded the corner and a plump fluffy sheep bounded into view.
            </p>
            <p>
              "BAAAAAAAA"
            </p>
            <p>
              "Ohh are you lost little one?", Swift laughed patting the sheep on its head. This seemed to annoy the four legged ball of wool which trotted over to Astrid with a determined look on its face, as determined as a sheep's face could be.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Hang on, there's something here around its neck," Astrid said as she knelt down to untie a scroll from under its head. It was a Scroll of Speak to Animals, at the bleating insistence of the sheep Astrid incanted the spell within and the baa-baa-ing gradually morphed into a cultured, elven-accented voice. 
            </p>
            <p>
              "Thank you Astrid, thank you. Finethir Shinebright and I am in your debt. I expect you have heard of me but there is no time to regale you with stories, I have been betrayed by my worthless apprentice and am being hounded by his despicable lackeys. I expect those fiends will be showing up any minute! Please you have to help me, I will see to it that you are richly rewarded."
            </p>
            <p>
              The other party members settled back with a grin, they never tired of watching their companion extract every last copper from some hapless fool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Astrid blinked. "How do you know my name?"
            </p>
            <p>
              "Oh I know far more than just your name. Help me Astrid. Help me and I can help you find your mother."
            </p>
            <p>
              A loud howling fills the air, accompanied by the sound of angry yells. The cause quickly becomes apparent as a huge Half-Orc swaggers towards the party, barking out orders at a trio of large wolves with strangely intelligent eyes and wearing iron collars. A hulking figure in a dirty brown cloak travels in their wake with footfalls loud enough to be heard over the ruckus. The Half-Orc sets his small eyes on the party and strides forward with one hand resting on the hilt of a greatsword.
            </p>
            <p>
              "That sheep is Master Noke's... he desires to have it back"
            </p>
            <p>
              "Ahem," coughed Regar. Everyone turns to see him standing to the side, a foot perched on a rock with one hand holding aloft his sword and the other outstretched, as if he was on stage at a play. "If you want - the sheep - you'll have to - have to go through me," he struggled to say, the exertion from flexing his muscles straining his breathing. Ovrin rolls his eyes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              "So be it!" snarled the Half-Orc rushing forward with his greatsword drawn. The three wolves surged into the party howling and snapping their jaws whilst in the back, the hulking figure shrugs off its robe to reveal a gigantic bear roaring with fury. The foes that day were indeed formidable and if they were facing the same six heroes that had first walked into a brewery about a rat problem those many moons ago, they may very well have slaugtered the heroes with ease. But this was not the same six heroes. The challenges they had faced, the trials they had overcome, all had served to strengthen them, as individuals and as a party. This was the Glowkindle Six.
            </p>
            <p>
              A barrage of Guiding Bolts erupted from Ovrin's hands, dealing grevious damage as they smashed into the enemies. Those still able to stand were illuminated with a magical glow, making them easy pickings for Makaria, firing killshot after killshot from her deadly longbow. Swift lived up to her namesake, darting with unnatural speed from foe to foe, dealing out death with devastating flurries of blows.
